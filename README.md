#Project 3 repository

## Start a new project repository in GitHub and then clone down to local machine. I leveraged VS Code clone functionality

## Create Virtual Environment

```shell

py -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Git add and commit 

```shell
git add .
git commit -m "add .gitignore, cmds to readme"
git push origin main
```
1. I imported to modules from previous work (lehman_utils) and (start_project)
2. The python script is organized by file type, I found this much easier to keep straight in my mind
    for example, all of the function for text are group together followed by .csv, etc
3. I had a lot of fun manipulating the csv data, when I orginally fetched the data the formatting was all one char per line 
4. I had to install and import Panda module, but this allowed me to convert excel data

This code was created by myself, for debugging purposes OpenAI was leveraged.
